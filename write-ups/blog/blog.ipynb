    "# Board Game Behavior: An Analysis of Demographics and Gameplay Preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "By: Dario Leyva-Brown, Marie Lawler, Seven Lewis\n",
    "\n",
    "Group 9\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project seeks to uncover interesting patterns among demographics and gameplay preferences at Western Washington University. Because we choose to go with survey, we constructed a curated set of survey questions to answer possible research questions. This enables a finer control over our raw data set at the cost of a smaller data set and possible bias. This project demonstrates how similar research can used for marketing research and improving accessibility and equality in the board game industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "Our survey consists of 16 questions which translate to the following features. For demographic info, we have Student/Faculty Status, Gender, Identity, Age,Race, Employment, Status, Corrective Vision, Religiosity, and Area of Study. For Board Game info we have, Enjoyment of Board Games, # of Board Games Owned, Frequency of Board Game Play, Style of Player, Desirable Gameplay Elements, Enjoyed Board Games, Scale Rating of Chess, and Desirable Board Game Genres. This survey was handed out to random students at WWU and received 243 responses. This translates to 243 rows. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Curation\n",
    "\n",
    "The data curation process consisted of downloading, processing, and cleaning the data. Microsoft Forms enabled the data collection and survey hosting. After loading the .xlxs file into a python juypter notebook, we reshaped the data for more effective analysis. First, we dropped irrelevant metadata including irrelevant fields like \"Time Started\", \"Name\", and \"Email.\" Next, we renamed the fields from their long question forms to concise feature names. For instance, \"What is your Gender Identity\" was simply renamed \"Gender.\" For a few multiselect questions, we had to have a different approach as, unlike single select question where each person can only select one answer, one person could have selected five different answers. In our case, we simply made each answer a \"boolean\" or bit answer. So, each multiselect question would expand to several fields with a 0 or 1 (for unselected and selected respectively). For example, the question \"I prefer games that include elements of:\" with the answers \"Strategy\" and \"Luck\" would expand into the features \"StrategyIsPreferredElement\" and \"LuckIsPreferredElement.\" For the \"Area of Study\" free form text response, we had to manually bucket these strings into large categories for meaningful cross analysis. After that, we shorted the answers to a few of our questions that had particularly long categorical answers (one of the Player Style answers was \"Strategy-focused player, enjoying games that require planning and tactics, but also participates in more casual games.\" which was shorted to \"Strategic\"). Finally, we assigned order to some categorical features like frequency of play where \"weekly\" should be greater than \"monthly\" etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "After plotting the raw counts of each of the features, it was clear that there were some categories and features that simply did not get enough diversity across responses to make any meaningful conclusions. Our survey was overwhelming answered by those who described their race as \"White\", thus no comparisons between Race and board game stats would be credible or representative. Similarly, religiosity's distribution was mostly agnostic/atheistic with the largest religious group being Christianity at about 30 responses (this was coped by analyzing grouping religious and non-religious with a 46/197 split), The \"Enjoyment of Board Games\" question was overwhelmingly answered with \"Yes\". For specific catagories, Employment Status had almost no full time responses, nor retired (which makes sense for the population surveyed). Gender received a nearly equal amount of Men and Women, however, non-binary received an insufficient amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the features received relatively expected count distributions. For instance: <img src=\"image.png\" alt=\"board game count plot\" style=\"width:600px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Board games owned for instance has a nearly perfect gaussian distribution. \n",
    "<img src=\"image-1.png\" alt=\"frequency of play count plot\" style=\"width:600px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequency of play also has a relatively gaussian distribution. \n",
    "<img src=\"image-2.png\" alt=\"chess rating count plot\" style=\"width:600px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Chess rating received a relatively uniform response profile, however, there are substantial spikes at 1 and 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following questions were answered primarily by feature against feature normalized bar charts. Or in other words, plotting the percentage distribution of responses for one category of a feature and comparing it graphically to the same distribution for another category of the same feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1: Does gender influence your relationship with board games?\n",
    "<img src=\"image-6.png\" alt=\"gender against chess rating\" style=\"width:600px;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"image-7.png\" alt=\"gender against preferred elements\" style=\"width:600px;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"image-8.png\" alt=\"gender against enjoyed genres\" style=\"width:866px;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"image-5.png\" alt=\"gender against style\" style=\"width:600px;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"image-3.png\" alt=\"gender against board games owned\" style=\"width:600px;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"image-4.png\" alt=\"gender against frequency of play\" style=\"width:600px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, gender does influence your relationship with board games. In our data on average, women are far more likely to give Chess a score of 1 (at around 25% of all women) compared to men and inversely men are far more likely to give Chess a score of 7 (at around 25% of all men). Additionally, women are about 20% more likely to select that they prefer party/low stakes as a board game element and/or genre compared to men. This is true of trivia as a preferred element/genre as well. For specifically genres, women were significantly more likely to select \"Adventure\", \"Animals\", \"Memory\", \"Puzzle\", and \"Luck\". Men were more likely to prefer the genres \"Deck-Building\", \"Fighting\", \"Role-Playing\", \"Science Fiction\", and \"World War II\". For style, men were about 7% more likely to describe themselves as \"strategic\". Women were similarly about 7% more likely to describe themselves as \"casual\". Interestingly, even though there are variance in preference, ones frequency of play and board games owned is fairly indifferent to their gender. There are some irregularities, like how significantly more men own zero games compared to women, but this discrepancy disappears for the other catagories in \"board games owned\". Overall, there is some variance between genders against board game stats but not overwhelmingly so.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2: How do specific sets of people rate chess? \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"image-9.png\" alt=\"chess rating against area of study\" style=\"width:600px;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"image-11.png\" alt=\"chess rating against isReligious\" style=\"width:600px;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"image-13.png\" alt=\"chess rating against style\" style=\"width:600px;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"image-10.png\" alt=\"chess rating against board games owned\" style=\"width:600px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Those who's area of study is within STEM are mildly more likely to enjoy chess than those in another area of study. Those that were religious almost never selected a number above 7. Strategic players are significantly more favorable towards Chess than any other group. The other styles had a more indifferent opinion to chess. As long as one owned 1 board game or more, their rating of chess would be fairly difficult to infer. However, those who own zero games are very unfavorable towards chess with the bottom 50% attributing a 2 or 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3: Do those who own more board games prefer different elements?\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"image-14.png\" alt=\"elements against board games owned\" style=\"width:600px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The general trend of more board games owned means more likely to enjoy each board game element is observed. Strategy is the most obvious instance of this pattern with a clear sheer line. This is not only expected, as those who own more board games are likely to be more exposed and appreciative of each element, but it makes the elements where this is generally not the case more interesting. For instance, \"Conflict/Competition\" and \"Party/Low-Stakes\" are all appreciated about equal. This demonstrates that those who play any board games at all are likely going to appreciate some fun competition or a low-stakes premise. Additionally, \"Trivia\" is generally less preferred, regardless of how many board games you own.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4: Does ones area of study impact which elements they enjoy?\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"image-15.png\" alt=\"area of study against elements\" style=\"width:600px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Area of Study is relatively indifferent to oneâ€™s selection of \"Preferred Board Game Elements\"\n",
    "However, there are still a few notable patterns. People with \"Arts & Humanities\" or \"Unknown\" Area of Study prefer \"Conflict\" and \"Party/Low-Stakes\" over \"STEM\". \"Arts & Humanities\" prefer \"Heavy/Immersive Theming\" by nearly double compared to \"STEM\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 5: What happens if we employ unsupervised clustering?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because our data is highly dimensional, we can use a unsupervised machine learning model to maybe discover interesting groupings that would be hard to discover otherwise. In our case, we utilized K-Means clustering to group the data by how \"close\" each data point is to a \"centroid\" or average point of the group. Fitting our data for two to ten clusters, we find that the number of clusters with the greatest silhouette score with by far was two clusters. This had a silhouette score 0.12, where three (the next greatest) only had 0.06. The two clusters distribution was 187 for 0 and 57 for 1.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Graphing the two clusters against different features revealed the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"image-16.png\" alt=\"clustering against number of board games\" style=\"width:600px;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"image-18.png\" alt=\"clustering against genre\" style=\"width:866px;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"image-17.png\" alt=\"clustering against gender\" style=\"width:600px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "For the number of board games owned, there is a clear divide between cluster 0 and cluster 1 forming two nearly perfect gaussian distributions with cluster 1 shifted right, on average owning more games. For each genre, the average likelihood of selection is always higher for those of cluster 1 than 0. These graphs show that the algorithm split the group into \"enthusiast\" and \"non-enthusiast\" players for 1 and 0 respectively. This is already fairly interesting, but perhaps expected, as those who buy more board games are more likely to be a fan of any given genre of board game. But, perhaps unexpectedly, there is no significant gender difference between clusters. This points to perhaps less bias within the industry as those who are likely to be enthusiastic about board games (those who own more board games and appreciate many genres) are no more likely to be men than women. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, many of our questions answers were answered expectedly. Those who rate chess higher are more likely to describe themselves as \"strategic\". Those who own more games like more gameplay elements. Enthusiastic gamers are more likely to prefer more genres. Even so, this makes our more novel discoveries more reliable. Chess, with in our data set, is clearly preferred by men than women. Area of study is relatively unrelated to which gameplay elements one prefers (one might expect those that are more \"mathy\" to be more keen on games). Those labeled \"enthusiast\" are labeled indifferent to gender. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Predictive Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Machine learning problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the response distribution for demographics was most strong with gender, we decided to select the task of predicting gender based on your board game related responses. This task, while relatively simple, demonstrates how marketing and business research can reasonably infer ones gender based on their behavior, and, in turn, use their gender to advertise them gender specific products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our $X$ for our machine learning model then were all the board game related features: 'EnjoysBoardGames', 'BoardGamesOwnedâ€™, 'FrequencyOfPlay', 'Style', 'ChessRating', 'PreferredElements', and'EnjoyedGenres'. No non-board game features were selected as that would defeat the point of our selected task. Additionally, we did not perform feature selection as we have already seen the feature distribution for gender and it would be a source of bias to only select the catagories that demonstrate the gender divide. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our $y$ is simply gender, however we excluded non-binary responses as we did not receive enough responses to reasonably train our machine learning model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our primary metric for this task is a simple confusion matrix accuracy. This is simply the total number of true positives and true negatives over all guesses. In other words, a percentage of true guesses. An accuracy of 100% is perfect while an accuracy score of 0% is extremely poor. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Models\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Baselines\n",
    "\n",
    "Our baselines used to ground our more complex models are \"most frequent\" and \"uniform\". Their role is to employ a trivial strategy that all more involved models should perform better than. If you're model is not performing better than a baseline, it tells you that something with your model is very poor. In our case, \"most frequent\" is simply using the strategy \"there are more women in the training set, so I will guess women every time.\" \"Uniform\" is saying \"each data point has an equal chance of being a man or a women, so I will guess at random\".\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Prospective algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "For our binary classification task, we choose to utilize the algorithms \"Logistic Regression\", \"K Neighbors Classifier\", \"Decision Tree Classifier\", and \"Random Forest Classifier\". Each of these employ unique strategies to properly classify new data given some set of training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we utilized hyper-parameterization enabled by Randomized Search Cross Validation on the \"Random Forest Classifier\". This is a strategy of trying hundreds of different combinations of hyper-parameters on a specific algorithm (in this case the Random Forest Classifier) and selecting the one with the highest cross validation score.   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data splits\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data splits were made by random selection of our selected features while stratifying the y's. These splits were an 80%/20% train/test with 168 data points in our training set and 42 in our test. In our validation steps we utilized 4 fold cross validation. In other words, in both our validating and testing steps, we attempt to predict the remaining 20% of all the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data transform\n",
    "\n",
    "Before employing each different classification model, the categorical variables must be translated or \"encoded\" into numbers. In our project, we utilized OneHot and Ordinal encoding. OneHot is simple feature expansion that transforms each category in a feature into a feature itself with a value of \"0\" or \"1\" depending on if it was selected. So, a OneHot encoding for \"Style\" would be \"style_strategic\", \"style_casual\", \"style_situation_specific\", etc, where for each row, only one of these features would have the value \"1\", with the rest being \"0\". Ordinal encoding is a little different. Instead of doing feature expansion, we simply assign a number to each category. This is best for catagories with a meaningful order as otherwise you are putting unrelated categories \"closer\" to one another than others. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our particular data set, we transformed the features \"Style\" and \"EnjoysBoardGames\" with the OneHot technique. For \"BoardGamesOwned\", \"FrequencyOfPlay\" and \"ChessRating\", we used OrdinalEncoding. The rest of the features are the boolean/bit field multiselect answers and do not need to be transformed before being used. \n",

    "\n",
    "Results for each model can be seen above. All non-trivial models perform better than both the most frequent and uniform models. Logistic Regression and Random Forest are both able to break 60% in terms of accuracy.

    "This results in the \"Tuned Random Forest Classifier\" score of 72%. \n",

    "\n",
    "This can also be expressed as a 79% accuracy. Compared to the baselines, which got 52% and 43% for most frequent and uniform respectively, the Tuned Random Forest Classifier is performing quite well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that this test set is relatively small, it's likely the case that this predictive power scales effectively and likely out performs our current model. In other words, given a sufficient set of features on board games with distribution differences for different demographics and enough data, you can have reasonable predictive power on those you do not know about yet. This sufficiently demonstrates the real world application of the predictive task. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Concluding remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, our project's scope of discovering patterns among demographics and gameplay preferences was limited to those who replied. And while that did lower the amount of interesting things we had to say about the group surveyed, we still walked away with plenty of meaningful analysis. Gender plays enough of a role on someone's board game preferences and engagement that we have a 79% chance of guessing it. Ones self reported \"style\" when it comes to board games falls in line with how much they enjoy the game chess. Those who owned more games and approved of more genre's on average (enthusiasts) were no more likely to be men, women, or non-binary. We demonstrated how this type of research and analysis can be used in more industrial settings. Perhaps future pursuit of this project can allow for an expansion of the scope again. More survey responses would enable more diversity in responses and allow for us to draw conclusions about groups we couldn't currently. We could also predict board game stats based on demographics, which would also articulate industry applications. Given ones demographics we could see how likely they are to be interested in board games.  \n",
