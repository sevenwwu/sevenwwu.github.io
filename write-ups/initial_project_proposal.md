## **Authors**:

## **Question:** How does ones demographics relate to exposure to board games?


## **Data:**

The data we are using for our project will be gathered genuinely through survey. The data does is exist but will take some amount of time to acquire. 

As of November 6th, 2023, we have 40 responses to our survey but plan to reach around 250 to 500 responses.

The data itself will be structured as individual response rows with each feature being a different question. The survey questions inquire about the following demographics:
- Student/Faculty Member Status
- Gender Identity
- Age
- Race
- Employment Status
- Corrective Vision
- Religiosity
- Area of Study

And the following board game questions:
- Enjoyment of Board Games
- \# of Board Games Owned
- Frequency of Board Game Play
- Style of Player
- Desirable Gameplay Elements
- Enjoyed Board Games
- Scale Rating of Chess
- Desirable Board Game Genres

## **Goal:**

We will use Python for exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning. This will be used to find patterns among demographics and board games as well as predict ones exposure to board games given a specific set of demographics. 


## Milestone 1 Deliverable (11/18/23):

Conditions for Milestone 1, otherwise pivot:
 - Data acquired will be at minimum (100 responses).
 - Data cleaning pipeline will be built
 - Exploratory analysis pipeline will be built for current and future responses.
    * Result must not appear null
 - Description write up for current project

If conditions are not met, we will submit another initial project deliverable alongside Milestone 1 (back-up dataset).


## Milestone 2 Deliverable (12/2/23):

 - Exploratory analysis will be completed and polished
 - Prediction model will be completed
