# **Board Game Behavior: An Analysis of Demographics and Gameplay Preferences**
# Milestone 1

## **Authors**:
Dario Leyva-Brown, Marie Lawler, Seven Lewis

# Current Completion
[ ] Minimum data acquired (at least 100 responses)

[ ] A data cleaning pipeline will have been established
    
    - Categorical Types for single choice
    - Bit field/ bool types for multiple choice
    - Manual bucketing of Area of Study/Major feature
    




[ ] An exploratory analysis pipeline will have been built for current and future response

[ ] Results must not appear trivial or null
[ ] A descriptive write-up for the current stage of the project will have been produced

# Current Progress
Need ML environment

Need to decide focus for ML

# Faults
Success on survey responses was tentative, thus establishing complete pipeline was deemed unlikely

Team explored other datasets and preliminary pipelines, which was costly

# Roadmap
[] Team will explore dataset for trends and meaningful correlations (Exploratory analysis complete)

[] Team will explore different Machine Learning models on decided features (Forest, KNearestNeighbor)
